\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

In 2012 industry consumed 2,542 Mtoe of energy globally, which represented  over 28\% of the 8,980 Mtoe of global final energy consumption \cite{IEA2012}. In an Irish context, industry consumed 2.26 Mtoe of energy in 2012, representing almost 22\% of Ireland’s 10.3 Mtoe of final energy consumption. Within the category of industrial energy, compressed air is recognised as an energy intensive utility, accounting for 10\% of industrial electricity in the European Union \cite{Saidur2010}. Energy costs typically account for 78\% of the total life cycle cost of a compressed air system \cite{radgen2006efficiency}. Compressed air is known colloquially in industry as the “fourth fuel”, due to the high electrical cost associated with generation. Compressed air systems are typically running at 19\% overall system efficiency \cite{Saidur2010}, due to energy losses largely due to lost heat of generation and leakages.




\section{Determining the operational performance of an air compressor}
\label{sec:probstatement}
A wide range of configurations and types of compressed air systems are installed in industry. In many cases there exist systems which are running sub-optimally, either due to unsuitability for the task at hand or running in a faulty condition. Given that compressed air represents such a dense form of energy transport, it is beneficial in terms of long and short term overall energy efficiency goals to manage the performance of air compressors. Performance management is typically achieved through means such as those in  \autoref{tab:perfmgmt}. The key disadvantages of existing methods are either that they are manual and periodic in nature, or that they require the intervention of a human expert in compressed air systems to be effective. In the case of maintenance contracts and periodic audits, there is also the potential for unnecessary work to be carried out, as both these measures are typically carried out on a timescale basis. The intervention of a human expert also lends itself to an inefficient method of performance measurement. An expert may be particularly well versed with one type of system, but not another. The disparate range of compressed air systems can lead to an expert restricting themselves to one type of system, preventing possible lessons learned to be applied in other suitable cases.

%	Bumph about current methods to detect performance degradation

In order to analyse a particular compressed air system it is useful to understand how it might relate to other installations. The system analysed in this paper consists of two rotary tooth air compressors with a heated desiccant dryer, with the layout given in \autoref{fig:compairlayout}. These machines are rotary tooth type machines, which are widely deployed across industry for applications with medium pressure and capacity requirements, as shown in \autoref{fig:CompApps}\cite{SEAI2007} The various types of compressors typically used in industry are shown in \autoref{fig:comptypes}. Reciprocating and rotary machines are both positive displacement type machines. They work through isolation of a quantity of air in a space which is then reduced in volume. Centrifugal machines are aerodynamic machines, which operate by imparting kinetic energy to air, which is then converted to pressure energy by stopping the moving air. The three most common types of compressor in industry are rotary, reciprocating and centrifugal machines. The application ranges of these types are shown in \autoref{fig:CompApps} \cite{SEAI2007}.

Research is being carried out to define the future of compressed air system performance management. In this review the research considered is that of ongoing analysis of compressed air system data. This ongoing analysis could be designated as having any of the goals outlined in \autoref{tab:goalsmgmt}.
