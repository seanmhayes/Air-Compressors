@article{Eret2011,
abstract = {While there are several best practice standards available for minimizing the energy requirement for compressed air use in an industrial context, moving to best practice often requires investment and operational change. In production facilities, there is often a reluctance to commit to this type of change without a clear view of the benefit. Furthermore, there is very little detailed information available in the open literature that allows even a qualitative assessment of priorities. In order to address this shortcoming, a practical approach is proposed to provide detailed compressed air consumption information throughout an industrial site. The energy of the compressed air is evaluated at each key element of the system and the typical end-use application profile assessed. Simple models of the consumption rates are used to relate duty cycle and device count with actual total consumption. This approach is complemented with a novel method of assessing the leak rate from the entire system, based on the pressure decay time. The method, referred to as the 'end use catalogue' has been demonstrated at a manufacturing site with a wide range of compressed air applications. The model has been used to identify the most significant energy-intensive compressed air applications and possible strategies to reduce the energy requirement. In the particular site used as a demonstration, it was found that open blowing operations (e.g. fluidizing) are the largest consumers of compressed air which are amenable to intervention. System leakage accounts for almost 21 per cent of the compressed air generated, representing an energy input of 432 kWh per day. It is concluded that this approach can help to identify priorities for optimizing compressed air use at an industrial site without compromising the production yield. Â© Authors 2011.},

Expressions for the volumetric effectiveness, the work per unit mass and the indicated efficiency are derived. The model has been used in order to predict the performance of a reciprocating air compressor under various operating conditions. The model proves to be a very accurate and useful tool to analyse the compressor performance. The relative importance of the various losses and the influence of different parameters on the reciprocating compressor behaviour are discussed. Especially the in-cylinder residual mass fraction and the wall to fluid heat transfer influences on the reciprocating compressor performance are highlighted. ?? 2001 ??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.},

@article{Chua2013,
abstract = {Air conditioning is essential for maintaining thermal comfort in indoor environments, particularly for hot and humid climates. Today, air conditioning, comprising cooling and dehumidification, has become a necessity in commercial and residential buildings and industrial processes. It accounts for a major share of the energy consumption of a building or facility. In tropical climates, the energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) can exceed 50{\%} of the total energy consumption of a building. This significant figure is primarily due to the heavy duty placed on cooling technologies to remove both sensible and latent heat loads. Therefore, there is tremendous potential to improve the overall efficiency of the air-conditioning systems in buildings.Based on today's practical technology for cooling, the major components of a chiller plant are (1) compressors, (2) cooling towers, (3) pumps (chilled and cooling water) and (4) fans in air handling units. They all consume mainly electricity to operate. When specifying the kW/R. ton of a plant, there are two levels of monitoring cooling efficiency: (1) at the efficiency of the chiller machines or the compressors which consume a major amount of electricity; and (2) at the overall efficiency of cooling plants which include the cooling towers, pumps for moving coolant (chilled and cooling water) to all air-handling units. Pragmatically, a holistic approach is necessary towards achieving a low energy input per cooling achieved such as 0.6. kW/R. ton cooling or lower by considering all aspects of the cooling plant.In this paper, we present a review of recent innovative cooling technology and strategies that could potentially lower the kW/R. ton of cooling systems - from the existing mean of 0.9. kW/R. ton towards 0.6. kW/R. ton or lower. The paper, broadly divided into three key sections (see Fig. 2), begins with a review of the recent novel devices that enhances the energy efficiency of cooling systems at the component level. This is followed by a review of innovative cooling systems designs that reduces energy use for air conditioning. Lastly, the paper presents recent developments in intelligent air-control strategies and smart chiller sequencing methodologies that reduce the primary energy utilization for cooling.The energy efficient cooling technology, innovative systems designs, and intelligent control strategies described in the paper have been recently researched or are on-going studies. Several have been implemented on a larger scale and, therefore, are examples of practical solutions that can be readily applied to suit specific needs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {With increasing demands for efficiency and product quality and progressing integration of automatic control systems in high-cost mechatronic and safety-critical processes, the field of supervision (or monitoring), fault detection and fault diagnosis plays an important role. The book gives an introduction into advanced methods of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). After definitions of important terms, the reliability, availability, safety and systems integrity of technical processes is considered. Then fault-detection methods for single signals without models like limit and trend checking and with harmonic and stochastic models, like Fourier analysis, correlation and wavelets are treated. This is followed by fault detection with process models using the relationships between signals like parameter estimation, parity equations, observers and principal component analysis. The treated fault-diagnosis methods include classification methods from Bayes classification to neural networks with decision trees and inference methods from approximate reasoning with fuzzy logic to hybrid fuzzy-neuro systems. Especially for safety-critical processes fault-tolerant systems are required. Basic redundant structures like n-out-of-m systems, cold and hot standby are considered and ways to design fault-tolerant sensors, actuators and control systems are outlined. Several practical examples for fault detection and diagnosis of DC motor drives, a centrifugal pump, automotive suspension and tire show applications.

abstract = {A novel process monitoring method based on modified Bayesian classification on PCA subspace is proposed. Fault detection and identification are the major steps to diagnose root causes of a process fault. However, before the faulty variables from the abnormal operations are identified, the different operating states need to be clustered from the historical data. The proposed approach modifies the Bayesian classification method to cluster data into groups. Therefore, a new fault identification index is derived based on cluster center and covariance. An industrial compressor process is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the example, process-insight-based variables were monitored along with the measured variables. The capability of fault diagnosis has been improved, since the fault identification indices are directly related to the variables with process characteristics. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {A qualitative approach for detecting a class of faults in a variable air volume air-handling system was developed. Using this approach, a wide class of operating faults can be analyzed. This paper focuses particularly on faults which result in deterioration of operation as distinct from actual failure - a situation known to occur frequently in practice. Conflicts between qualitative results values of the controller states as actually observed and those expected - as derived from the measured qualitative temperature states - provide evidence of such faults.},

abstract = {In the aircraft industry, it is common to use physically redundant components to ensure that the overall system meets the necessary safety requirements. For systems where physical redundancy is impractical (e.g, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), analytical redundancy can be used to reduce the number of components needed. However, it is more difficult to certify the safety of an analytically redundant system. This paper presents a performance analysis framework that applies to both physically and analytically redundant sensor systems with linear time-invariant dynamics and additive faults. The framework is used to compare and certify the performance of two air-data sensor examples - one with physically redundant altitude sensors, and another that exploits the analytical relationship between altitude, airspeed, and flight path angle. In both examples, a threshold fault detection scheme is used. Â© 2011 AACC American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {Energy-saving of compressed air system was very important for the sustainable development of enterprises, which could be achieved though fast and accurate load forecasting. In this paper, according to the distribution rules and characteristics of 24 hours compressed air supply, the 24h compressed air flow demand model was firstly built with least square support vector machine (LSSVM). In order to avoid the long time consumption for determining the model parameters in the traditional cross validation method, Bayesian evidence framework was selected to train the parameters, and then identified and optimized them. Meanwhile, Nystr{\"{o}}m low- rank approximation decomposition algorithm was used to accelerate kernel matrix decomposition process. Though the experimental verification with real industrial data, the modeling time of LSSVM within Bayesian evidence framework is reduced to 1/20 compared with traditional cross-validation method; in the contrast with Practical Swarm Optimization (PSO), the modeling time is reduced to 80{\%}, and the prediction accuracy can increase 14.3{\%}, proving this method quite suitable for fast and accurate forecasting for large flow compressed air load.

Fault detection is based on the use of parity equations assuming unknown but bounded description of the noise and modeling errors. The fault detection test is based on checking the consistency between the measurements and the model by finding if the formers are inside the interval prediction bounds. The fault isolation algorithm is based on analyzing the observed fault signatures on-line, and matching them with the theoretical ones obtained using structural analysis. Finally, the proposed approach is tested using the wind farm benchmark proposed in the context of the wind farm FDI/FTC competition.},

Various forms of qualitative models such as causal models and abstraction hierarchies are discussed. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these representations are highlighted. In terms of search strategies, we broadly classify them as topographic and symptomatic search techniques. Topographic searches perform malfunction analysis using a template of normal operation, whereas, symptomatic searches look for symptoms to direct the search to the fault location.

@article{Venkatasubramanian2003b,
abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis is an important problem in process engineering. It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated AEM as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard-based frameworks for fault diagnosis.},

abstract = {For the improvement of reliability, safety and efficiency advanced methods of supervision, fault detection and fault diagnosis become increasingly important for many technical processes. This holds especially for safety related processes like aircraft, trains, automobiles, power plants and chemical plants. The classical approaches are limit or trend checking of some measurable output variables. Because they do not give a deeper insight and usually do not allow a fault diagnosis, model-based methods of fault detection were developed by using input and output signals and applying dynamic process models. These methods are based, e.g., on parameter estimation, parity equations or state observers. Also signal model approaches were developed. The goal is to generate several symptoms indicating the difference between nominal and faulty status. Based on different symptoms fault diagnosis procedures follow, determining the fault by applying classification or inference methods. This contribution gives a short introduction into the field and shows some applications for an actuator, a passenger car and a combustion engine.},

We also compare and evaluate the various methodologies reviewed in this series in terms of the set of desirable characteristics we proposed in Part I. This comparative study reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches. One realizes that no single method has all the desirable features one would like a diagnostic system to possess. It is our view that some of these methods can complement one another resulting in better diagnostic systems. Integrating these complementary features is one way to develop hybrid systems that could overcome the limitations of individual solution strategies. The important role of fault diagnosis in the broader context of process operations is also outlined. We also discuss the technical challenges in research and development that need to be addressed for the successful design and implementation of practical intelligent supervisory control systems for the process industries.},

In particular, the new models give a better description of part-load performance than previously published models. These models have been incorporated, along with those for the other elements of steam systems, into an overall model for utility cogeneration systems. The degrees of freedom of steam systems allow significant opportunity for cost reduction through optimization. This results from the complexity of the interactions within such systems, the continually changing demands on the system and the complexity of cost tariffs for power and fuel. This paper presents improved methods for both the simulation and optimization of utility systems based on the improved models. Using the method presented, significant cost savings can be made by optimizing the system operation at no capital cost. Case studies show a significant potential for cost savings.},

abstract = {In this paper, an efficient scheme to detect the unprecedented changes in system reliability and find the failed component state by classifying the faults is proposed using kalman filter and hybrid neuro-fuzzy computing techniques. A fault is detected whenever the moving average of the Kalman filter residual exceeds a threshold value. The fault classification has been made effective by implementing a hybrid Genetic Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GANFIS). By doing so, the critical information about the presence or absence of a fault is gained in the shortest possible time, with not only confirmation of the findings but also an accurate unfolding-in-time of the finer details of the fault, thus completing the overall fault diagnosis picture of the system under test. The proposed scheme is evaluated extensively on a two-tank process used in industry exemplified by a benchmarked laboratory scale coupledtank system.},

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

Multi-state system reliability models allow both the system and its components to assume more than two levels of performance.

The method includes additional information such as measurement data via Bayesian modeling to reduce estimation uncertainties. Laplace approximation method is used to evaluate Bayesian posterior distributions analytically. An efficient algorithm based on inverse first-order reliability method is developed to evaluate system responses given a reliability index or confidence interval. Since the proposed method involves no simulations such as Monte Carlo or Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, the overall computational efficiency improves significantly, particularly for problems with complicated performance functions. A practical fatigue crack propagation problem with experimental data, and a structural scale example are presented for methodology demonstration.

abstract = {The paper presents a multivariate statistical approach that supports the classification of mechanical components, subjected to specific operating conditions, in terms of the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF). Assessing the influence of working conditions and/or environmental factors on the MTBF is a prerequisite for the development of an effective preventive maintenance plan. However, this task may be demanding and it is generally performed with ad-hoc experimental methods, lacking of statistical rigor. To solve this common problem, a step by step multivariate data classification technique is proposed. Specifically, a set of structured failure data are classified in a meaningful way by means of: (i) cluster analysis, (ii) multivariate analysis of variance, (iii) feature extraction and (iv) predictive discriminant analysis. This makes it possible not only to define the MTBF of the analyzed components, but also to identify the working parameters that explain most of the variability of the observed data. The approach is finally demonstrated on 126 centrifugal pumps installed in an oil refinery plant; obtained results demonstrate the quality of the final discrimination, in terms of data classification and failure prediction. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To do that, they have to be measured along side tangibles whose measurements must also be evaluated as to, how well, they serve the objectives of the decision maker. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a theory of measurement through pairwise comparisons and relies on the judgements of experts to derive priority scales. It is these scales that measure intangibles in relative terms. The comparisons are made using a scale of absolute judgements that represents, how much more, one element dominates another with respect to a given attribute. The judgements may be inconsistent, and how to measure inconsistency and improve the judgements, when possible to obtain better consistency is a concern of the AHP. The derived priority scales are synthesised by multiplying them by the priority of their parent nodes and adding for all such nodes. An illustration is included.},

abstract = {A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data. In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling approach using a real-world case study.},

A suitable procedure for optimisation of the screw compressor shape, size, dimension and operating parameters is described here, which results in the most appropriate design for a given compressor application and fluid. It is based on a rack generation algorithm for rotor profile combined with a numerical model of the compressor fluid flow and thermodynamic processes. Some optimisation issues of the rotor profile and compressor parts are discussed, using 5/6 screw compressor rotors to present the results. It is shown that the optimum rotor profile, compressor speed, oil flow rate and temperature may significantly differ when compressing different gases or vapours or if working at the oil-free or oil-flooded mode of operation. Compressors thus designed achieve higher delivery rates and better efficiencies than those using traditional approaches, which is illustrated in an example of the 3/5 screw rotors designed for a family of dry air compressors, produced and marketed by a renown British compressor manufacturer. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Global energy demand is predicted to increase dramatically over the next 25 years, forc- ing energy prices to rise accordingly. In order to alle- viate the impact of this energy price rise, more and more research is focusing on the efficient utilisation of energy. The research work presented here focuses on the manu- facturing sector and provides an insight into the level of energy transparency that can be achieved by connecting an effective energy metering system to a robust energy management platform in order to monitor and control the energy requirements of a manufacturing plant. As the level of energy transparency increases, the number of meters, quantity of data and complexity of data handling increases correspondingly. Achieving total energy visibil- ity within a manufacturing facility allows management to accurately identify, prioritise and record new opportunities for improving overall energy efficiency. The development and application of energy consumption metrics then allows energy performance to be monitored on a continuous basis. The results of this study highlight the benefits associ- ated with disaggregating the total electrical consumption into significant energy users and monitoring each user independently.},

abstract = {Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are developed and implemented to classify a four-stage high pressure air compressor into one of the following conditions: baseline, suction or exhaust valve faults. These FNNs are used for the compressorâs automatic condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Measurements of 39 variables are obtained under different baseline conditions and third-stage suction and exhaust valve faults. These variables include pressures and temperatures at all stages, voltage between phaseaand phaseb, voltage between phaseband phasec, total three-phase real power, cooling water flow rate, etc. To reduce the number of variables, the amount of their discriminatory information is quantified by scattering matrices to identify statistical significant ones. Measurements of the selected variables are then used by a fully automatic structural and weight learning algorithm to construct three-layer FNNs to classify the compressorâs condition. This learning algorithm requires neither guesses of initial weight values nor number of neurons in the hidden layer of an FNN.

abstract = {Fault diagnosis in reciprocating air compressors is essential for continuous monitoring of their performance and thereby ensuring quality output. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are machine learning tools based on structural risk minimization principle and have the advantageous characteristic of good generalization. For this reason, four well-known and widely used SVM based methods, one-against-one (OAO), oneagainst-all (OAA), fuzzy decision function (FDF), and DDAG have been used here and an optimized SVM based technique is proposed for classification based fault diagnosis in reciprocating air compressors. The results obtained through implementation of all five techniques are thus compared as per their accuracy rate in percentages and the performance of the proposed method with 98.03 percent accuracy rate was found to be better than all other classification methods. With the compressor datasets being complex natured, proposed method is found to be of vital importance for classification based fault diagnosis pertaining to reciprocating air compressors.},

abstract = {Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are developed and implemented to classify a four-stage high pressure air compressor into one of the following conditions: baseline, suction or exhaust valve faults. These FNNs are used for the compressorâs automatic condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Measurements of 39 variables are obtained under different baseline conditions and third-stage suction and exhaust valve faults. These variables include pressures and temperatures at all stages, voltage between phaseaand phaseb, voltage between phaseband phasec, total three-phase real power, cooling water flow rate, etc. To reduce the number of variables, the amount of their discriminatory information is quantified by scattering matrices to identify statistical significant ones. Measurements of the selected variables are then used by a fully automatic structural and weight learning algorithm to construct three-layer FNNs to classify the compressorâs condition. This learning algorithm requires neither guesses of initial weight values nor number of neurons in the hidden layer of an FNN. It takes an incremental approach in which a hidden neuron is trained by exemplars and then augmented to the existing network. These exemplars are then made orthogonal to the newly identified hidden neuron. They are subsequently used for the training of the next hidden neuron.

The main obstacle in the fault diagnosis focuses on the low non-linear pattern recognition performance and small sample number. Therefore, the information entropy, which is flexible and tolerant to the non-linearity problem, is applied to analyze the characteristic of the signals. SVM is employed in the fault classification because of its superiority in dealing with smaller sample problem. The information entropy features and the optimization test of the SVM model are detailed analyzed.

abstract = {A scheme for fault detection of compressor valves based on basis pursuit (BP), wave matching and support vector machine (SVM) is presented. BP is applied to extract the main vibration component in the signal and suppress background noise. Wave matching is a new feature extraction method proposed in this paper. Instead of extracting features through commonly used indicators such as statistic measures or information entropy, wave matching extracts features by matching the vibration signal with parameterized waveform optimized by differential evolution (DE) algorithm. It only produces a small number of features and the features have clear physical meaning. SVM is employed in the fault classification because of its superiority in dealing with small sample problems. The results of real compressor valve signal analysis confirm that the proposed scheme can differentiate compressor valve faults with high accuracy and reliability. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Tran2014,
abstract = {This paper presents an approach to implement vibration, pressure, and current signals for fault diagnosis of the valves in reciprocating compressors. Due to the complexity of structure and motion of such compressor, the acquired vibration signal normally involves transient impacts and noise. This causes the useful information to be corrupted and difficulty in accurately diagnosing the faults with traditional methods. To reveal the fault patterns contained in this signal, the Teager-Kaiser energy operation (TKEO) is proposed to estimate the amplitude envelopes. In case of pressure and current, the random noise is removed by using a denoising method based on wavelet transform. Subsequently, statistical measures are extracted from all signals to represent the characteristics of the valve conditions. In order to classify the faults of compressor valves, a new type of learning architecture for deep generative model called deep belief networks (DBNs) is applied. DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and works through a greedy layer-by-layer learning algorithm. In pattern recognition research areas, DBN has proved to be very effective and provided with high performance for binary values. However, for implementing DBN to fault diagnosis where most of signals are real-valued, RBM with Bernoulli hidden units and Gaussian visible units is considered in this study. The proposed approach is validated with the signals from a two-stage reciprocating air compressor under different valve conditions. To confirm the superiority of DBN in fault classification, its performance is compared with that of relevant vector machine and back propagation neuron networks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Within the operational phase buildings are now producing more data than ever before, from energy usage, utility information, occupancy patterns, weather data, etc. In order to manage a building holistically it is important to use knowledge from across these information sources. However, many barriers exist to their interoperability and there is little interaction between these islands of information. As part of moving building data to the cloud there is a critical need to reflect on the design of cloud-based data services and how they are designed from an interoperability perspective. If new cloud data services are designed in the same manner as traditional building management systems they will suffer from the data interoperability problems. Linked data technology leverages the existing open protocols and W3C standards of the Web architecture for sharing structured data on the web. In this paper we propose the use of linked data as an enabling technology for cloud-based building data services. The objective of linking building data in the cloud is to create an integrated well-connected graph of relevant information for managing a building. This paper describes the fundamentals of the approach and demonstrates the concept within a Small Medium sized Enterprise (SME) with an owner-occupied office building.},

An initial "standard" commercial configuration is gradually improved by introducing design changes aimed at the reduction of the thermodynamic losses due to heat transfer and fluid friction. Different geometries (pins, fins and others) are analysed with a commercial CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code that also computes the local entropy generation rate. The design improvement process is carried out on the basis of a careful analysis of the local entropy generation maps and the rationale behind each step of the process is discussed in this perspective. The results are compared with other entropy generation minimization techniques available in the recent technical literature. It is found that the geometry with pin-fins has the best performance among the tested ones, and that the optimal pin array shape parameters (pitch and span) can be determined by a critical analysis of the integrated and local entropy maps and of the temperature contours. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Electric motor and power electronics-based inverter are the major components in industrial and automotive electric drives. In this paper, we present a model-based fault diagnostics system developed using a machine learning technology for detecting and locating multiple classes of faults in an electric drive. Power electronics inverter can be considered to be the weakest link in such a system from hardware failure point of view; hence, this work is focused on detecting faults and finding which switches in the inverter cause the faults. A simulation model has been developed based on the theoretical foundations of electric drives to simulate the normal condition, all single-switch and post-short-circuit faults. A machine learning algorithm has been developed to automatically select a set of representative operating points in the (torque, speed) domain, which in turn is sent to the simulated electric drive model to generate signals for the training of a diagnostic neural network, fault diagnostic neural network (FDNN). We validated the capability of the FDNN on data generated by an experimental bench setup. Our research demonstrates that with a robust machine learning approach, a diagnostic system can be trained based on a simulated electric drive model, which can lead to a correct classification of faults over a wide operating domain.},

abstract = {Heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC{\&}R) systems operated under faulty condition often result in extra energy consumption (up to 30{\%} for commercial buildings) and cost, less comfort control and bad indoor/outdoor air quality, especially when multiple faults happening simultaneously. This study presents a novel hybrid strategy that combines support vector machine (SVM) and multi-label (ML) technique for the automated detection and diagnosis of multiple-simultaneous faults (MSF), and elaborates its application to a building chiller. One of the great advantages ML has against the mono-label (mL) technique is that no MSF data are needed for model training while a good FDD performance for MSF could be obtained. Two individual chiller faults and one of their combinations (an MSF) were investigated. Detailed studies on the use of three features sets and the training of the model with/without normal or/and MSF data were conducted and compared with the mLâSVM model. The results show that the MLâSVM model trained on the normal and two individual faults has an excellent performance, especially when the eight fault-indicative features (Feat8) were employed (correct rate over 99.9{\%}). Feat8 behaves still excellent even when Gaussian white noise has been added to the test data.},

abstract = {The design and implementation of a probabilistic model-based fault diagnosis expert system is described in this paper. Possible cause and effect graph (PCEG) methodology, an enhanced signed-directed graph (SDG) approach, was used for qualitative modeling. A rule-based approach is proposed to transform the Bayesian belief network into an acyclic network dynamically during the diagnosis phase to allow simple on-line probability calculation in a belief network with causality loops. A dynamic time-delay methodology is also proposed to manage the possibility of phantom alarms, which are the consequences of process time-delays. The application to a pilot scale distillation column with communication with DCS environment is presented. Two sample runs were included to demonstrate the concept of dynamic causal network modification and time-delay management. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method for centrifugal chillers of building air-conditioning systems. Firstly, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) is adopted to develop the reference PI models. A new PI, namely the heat transfer efficiency of the sub-cooling section (Ésc), is proposed to improve the FDD performance. Secondly, the Exponentially-Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control charts are introduced to detect faults in a statistical way to improve the ratios of correctly detected points. Thirdly, when faults are detected, diagnosis follows which is based on a proposed FDD rule table. Six typical chiller component faults are concerned in this paper. This method is validated using the real-time experimental data from the ASHRAE RP-1043. Test results show that the combined use of SVR and EWMA can achieve the best performance. Results also show that significant improvements are achieved compared with a commonly used method using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and t-statistic.},

abstract = {Pneumatic systems repeat the identical programmed sequence during their operation. The data was collected when the pneumatic system worked perfectly and had some faults including empty magazine, zero vacuum, inappropriate material, no pressure, closed manual pressure valve, missing drilling stroke, poorly located material, not vacuuming the material and low air pressure. The signals of eight sensors were collected during the entire sequence and the 24 most descriptive features of the data were encoded to present to the ANNs. A synthetic data generation process was proposed to train and test the ANNs better when signals are extremely repetitive from one sequence to other. Two artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for interpretation of the encoded signals. The tested ANNs were Adaptive Resonance Theory 2 (ART2), and Back propagation (Bp). ART2 correctly distinguished the perfect and faulty operations at all the tested vigilance values. It classified 11 faulty and 1 normal modes in seven or eight categories at the best vigilance values. Bp also distinguished perfect and faulty operations without even the slightest uncertainty. In less than 10 cases, it had difficulty identifying the 11 types of possible faults. The average estimation error of the Bp was better than 2.1{\%} of the output range on the test data which was created by deviating the encoded values. The ART2 and Bp performance was found excellent with the proposed encoding and synthetic data generation procedures for extremely repetitive sequential data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The application of artificial neural network to compressor performance map prediction is investigated. Different types of artificial neural networks such as general regression neural network, rotated general regression neural network proposed by the authors, radial basis function network, and multilayer perceptron network are considered. Two different models are utilized in simulating the performance map. The results indicate that while the rotated general regression neural network has the least mean error and best agreement to the experimental data; it is however, limited to interpolation application. On the other hand, if one considers a tool for interpolation as well as extrapolation applications, multilayer perceptron network technique is the most powerful candidate. Further, the compressor efficiency based on the multilayer perceptron network technique is determined. Excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data is obtained. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A way to optimize the parameters (i.e. operating conditions), related to compressor performance, based on artificial neural network and the Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method is proposed. It inverts the neural network to find the optimum parameter value under given conditions (artificial neural network inverse, ANNi). In order to do so, first an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to predict: compressor pressure ratio, isentropic compressor efficiency, corrected speed, and finally corrected air mass flow rate. Input variables for this ANN include: ambient pressure, ambient temperature, wet bulb temperature, cooler temperature drop, filter pressure drop, outlet compressor temperature, outlet compressor pressure, gas turbine net power, exhaust gas temperature, and finally fuel flow mass rate. For the network, a feed-forward with one hidden layer, a Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer-function and a linear transfer-function were used. The best fitting with the training database was obtained with 12 neurons in the hidden layer. For the validation of present database, simulation and experimental database were in good agreement (R2 > 0.99). Thus, the obtained ANN model can be used to predict the operating conditions when input parameters are well-known. Second, results from the ANNi that was developed also show good agreement with experimental and target data (error <0.1{\%}), in this case, cooler temperature was found for a required efficiency. Therefore, the proposed methodology of ANNi can be applied to optimize the performance of the compressor with an elapsed time minor to 0.5 s. Â© 2009.},

The key feature of the proposed procedure can be identified as its underlying capability to detect novelties in the system's mode of operation and, thus, to identify previously unseen functioning modes of the process. Once a novelty is detected, relevant informations are used to enrich the knowledge-base of the algorithm and as a result the proposed clustering procedure evolves and learns the new features of the monitored process in accordance with the available process data. The suggested clustering procedure is theoretically illustrated and its effectiveness has been investigated experimentally. Particularly, the on-line implementation of the algorithm and its integration with a fault detection expert system have been considered by making reference to a pneumatic process.

abstract = {The most troublesome part in the development of a component-based engine models is the compressor module because of the strong dependence of its performance on rotational speed. For this purpose, a performance characteristics estimation method of multi-stage axial flow compressors are proposed in this paper. The newly proposed estimation technique of average infinitesimal stage characteristics satisfies the analogy criterion perfectly due to the use of a new conception of infinitesimal stage and the improved analogy theory. The overall compressor performance characteristics are estimated through a stage by stage calculation based on the improved analogy theory and the average stage characteristics. To minimize the error between the calculated characteristic and the tested characteristic of the compressor at high rotational speeds, the average stages performance characteristics are identified using an optimization method. The technique improves the traditional scaling method by taking into account the effects of air density change and rotational speeds, and it makes use of available data efficiently. In addition, it reflects the own performance characteristics of the original compressor. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A transient simulation model of a rolling piston type rotary compressor is developed to predict the dynamic characteristics of a variable speed compressor. The model is based on the principles of conservation, real gas equations, kinematics of the crankshaft and roller, mass flow loss due to leakage, and heat transfer. For the computer simulation of the compressor, the experimental data were obtained from motor performance tests at various operating frequencies. Using the developed model, re-expansion loss, friction loss, mass flow loss and heat transfer loss is estimated as a function of the crankshaft speed in a variable speed compressor. In addition, the compressor efficiency and energy losses are predicted at various compressor-operating frequencies. Since the transient state of the compressor strongly depends on the system, the developed model is combined with a transient system simulation program to get transient variations of the compression process in the system. Motor efficiency, mechanical efficiency, motor torque and volumetric efficiency are calculated with respect to variation of the driving frequency in a rotary compressor. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper gives an introduction to the field of fault detection and diagnosis. It begins with a consideration of a knowledge-based procedure that is based on analytical and heuristic information. Then different methods of fault detection are considered, which extract features from measured signals and use process and signal models. These methods are based on parameter estimation, state estimation and parity equations. By comparison with the normal behaviour, analytic symptoms are generated. Human operators are another source of information, and support the generation of heuristic symptoms. For fault diagnosis, all symptoms have to be processed in order to determine possible faults. This can be performed by classification methods or approximate reasoning, using probabilistic or possibilistic (fuzzy) approaches based on if-then-rules.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st century. Its most severe impacts may still be avoided if efforts are made to transform current energy systems. Renewable energy sources have a large potential to displace emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels and thereby to mitigate climate change. If implemented properly, renewable energy sources can contribute to social and economic development, to energy access, to a secure and sustainable energy supply, and to a reduction of negative impacts of energy provision on the environment and human health. This Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) impartially assesses the scientifi c literature on the potential role of renewable energy in the mitigation of climate change for policymakers, the private sector, academic researchers and civil society. It covers six renewable energy sources â bioenergy, direct solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy and wind energy â as well as their integration into present and future energy systems. It considers the environmental and social consequences associated with the deployment of these technologies, and presents strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion. The authors also compare the levelized cost of energy from renewable energy sources to recent non-renewable energy costs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with a clear scientifi c view on the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.},

This research examines the extent to which software designs actually decay by studying the aging of design patterns in successful object oriented systems. Aging of design patterns is measured using various types of decay indices developed for this research. Decay indices track the internal structural changes of a design pattern realization and the code that surrounds the realization. Hypotheses for each kind of decay are tested. We found that the original design pattern functionality remains, and pattern decay is due to the "grime ", non-pattern code, that grows around the pattern realization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a short study into utilising wind farm supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system data for performance monitoring of large utility-scale wind turbines. The general approach taken is to model the turbine power output of each turbine during fault-free operation and to subsequently use the trained model to identify performance degradation by analysing the residual between the predicted and observed power values for each turbine. Historical data from a large wind farm is used to train and test the turbine models. The trained models are then tested on historical turbine failure examples. The results suggest that the data collected by wind farm SCADA systems, which are typically installed as standard on most modern wind farms, can be exploited for gaining an insight into wind turbine performance and maintenance condition.},

@article{LeifHanrahan2014,
abstract = {The combination of wind generation and combined heat and power (CHP) on an industrial site brings significant design and operational challenges. The stochastic nature of wind power affects the flows of electricity imported and exported to and from the site. Economies of scale favor larger wind turbines, but at the same time it is also desirable to minimize the amount of electricity exported from the site to avoid incurring increased network infrastructure usage charges. Therefore the optimum situation is to maximize the proportion of the site load served by on-site generation. This paper looks at a visualization technique for power flows on an industrial site, which can be used to size on-site generators. The technique is applied to a test case, demonstrating how a simple combined heat and power control scheme can support the integration of on-site wind power. The addition of such CHP control has a small impact on the CHP unit but can greatly increase the proportion of wind generation consumed on-site. This visualization technique allows the comparison of different generation mixes and control schemes in order to arrive at the optimal mix from a technical and economic viewpoint. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Buildings in the United States and China consumed 41{\%} and 28{\%} of the total primary energy in 2011, respectively. Good energy data are the cornerstone to understanding building energy performance and supporting research, design, operation, and policy making for low energy buildings. This paper presents initial outcomes from a joint research project under the U.S.âChina Clean Energy Research Center for Building Energy Efficiency. The goal is to decode the driving forces behind the discrepancy of building energy use between the two countries; identify gaps and deficiencies of current building energy monitoring, data collection, and analysis; and create knowledge and tools to collect and analyze good building energy data to provide valuable and actionable information for key stakeholders. This paper first reviews and compares several popular existing building energy monitoring systems in both countries. Next a standard energy data model is presented. A detailed, measured building energy data comparison was conducted for a few office buildings in both countries. Finally issues of data collection, quality, sharing, and analysis methods are discussed. It was found that buildings in both countries performed very differently, had potential for deep energy retrofit, but that different efficiency measures should apply.},

abstract = {This study explains how to appraise the operating performance of a chiller system using cluster and multivariate analyses. Cluster analysis is a statistical tool used to identify groups of individuals similar to each other but different from individuals in other groups. This serves the purpose of classifying what operating condition constitutes a high or low system coefficient of performance (COP). A case study has been carried out on a system with five sets of chillers, pumps and cooling towers. Each operating condition to be clustered involves the following variables: the load of each operating chiller, the total system load, the number of primary chilled water pumps running, the number of condenser water pumps running and the number of cooling towers operating. The two-step cluster analysis was applied to group around 6800 sets of operating conditions into three clusters with distinct operating characteristics. For each clustered data, a multivariate analysis was made to examine the degree of correlation between the system coefficient of performance (COP), the operating variables and typical weather parameters. The significance of this study is to demonstrate a systematic method to ascertain if a chiller system operates under optimal control with maximum COP and to estimate COP improvements if operating problems are rectified.},

Our research indicates that, in comparison to traditional model-based or data-driven methods, the combination of time series modeling and machine learning techniques produces higher accuracy and lower false alarm rates in FDD for chillers. In this paper, we study a hybrid method incorporating auto-regressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) and support vector machines (SVM). A high dimensional parameter space is constructed by the ARX model and SVM sub-divides the parameter space with hyper-planes, enabling fault classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over conventional approaches with higher prediction accuracy and lower false alarm rates.},

abstract = {A generic intelligent fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) strategy is proposed in this study to simulate the actual diagnostic thinking of chiller experts. A three-layer Diagnostic Bayesian Network (DBN) is developed to diagnose chiller faults based on the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) theory. The structure of the DBN is a graphical and qualitative illustration of the intrinsic causal relationships among causal factors in Layer 1, faults in Layer 2 and fault symptoms in Layer 3. The parameters of the DBN represent the quantitative probabilistic relationships among the three layers. To diagnose chiller faults, posterior probabilities of the faults under observed evidences are calculated based on the probability analysis and the graph theory. Compared with other FDD strategies, the proposed strategy can make use of more useful information of the chiller concerned and expert knowledge. It is effective and efficient in diagnosing faults based on uncertain, incomplete and conflicting information. Evaluation of the strategy was made on a 90-ton water-cooled centrifugal chiller reported in ASHRAE RP-1043.},

abstract = {To detect degradation in the energy efficiency of a chiller in a chiller plant, a multivariate Gaussian mixture model is applied. This classification technique was selected due to hypothesized correlation between variables because of their physical interpretation and centering on a mean due to equipment and operation specifications and system control targets. The hidden variable is the faultiness of the chiller and can take on one of three possibly states. The five observed variables correspond to sensor measurements that are commonly available on commercially available chillers and that are commonly monitored in commercial chiller plants. The fault detection algorithm is trained on simulated data for the Molecular Foundry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Then, the model is tested on measured sensor data. The results show that detection of a severe fault and of no fault is the easiest, while detection of moderate faults is sometimes mistaken for severe faults. Further analysis on sensitivity to training data and the fit of the probability distribution is also conducted. The computation needs are moderate enough for deployment and continuous energy monitoring.},

abstract = {Eleven years after Lung Health Study (LHS) entry, we performed spirometry in 77.4{\%} of surviving participants who enrolled in a long-term follow-up study. Those not enrolling tended to be younger male heavy smokers who continued to smoke during the LHS. Their initial LHS lung function, after adjustment for these factors, did not differ from that of enrollees. Smoking habits by original LHS treatment groups (smoking intervention vs. usual care) tended to converge, but 93{\%} of participants who were abstinent throughout the LHS were still abstinent at 11 years. Differences in lung function between treatment groups persisted; smoking intervention participants had less decline in FEV(1) than usual care participants. Men who quit at the beginning of the LHS had an FEV(1) rate of decline of 30.2 ml/year, whereas women who quit declined at 21.5 ml/year. Men continuing to smoke throughout the 11 years declined by 66.1 ml/year, and women continuing to smoke declined by 54.2 ml/year. When decline in FEV(1) was expressed as a percentage of predicted normal value, no significant sex-based difference was apparent among continuing smokers. At 11 years, 38{\%} of continuing smokers had an FEV(1) less than 60{\%} of the predicted normal value compared with 10{\%} of sustained quitters.},

abstract = {We propose a novel framework for Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) that uses active testing to decrease the diagnostic uncertainty. This framework is called LYDIA-NG and combines several diagnostic, simulation, and active-testing algorithms. We have illustrated the workings of LYDIA-NG by building a LYDIA-NG-based decision support system for the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. This paper discusses a model of the GOCE Electrical Power System (EPS), the algorithms for diagnosis and disambiguation, and the experiments performed with a number of diagnostic scenarios. Our experiments produced no false positive scenarios, no false negative scenarios, the average number of classification errors per scenario is 1.25, and the fault detection time is equal to the computation time. We have further computed an average fault uncertainty of 2.06 Ã 10â3 which can be automatically reduced to 9.5Ã10â4 by sending a single, automatically computed, telecommand, thus dramatically reducing the fault isolation time.},

abstract = {Compressed-air systems account for about 10{\%} of total industrial-energy use for few selected countries as found in literatures. Compressed air is typically one of the most expensive utilities in an industrial facility. This paper describes a comprehensive literature review about compressed air energy use, savings, and payback period of energy efficient strategies. This paper compiles latest literatures in terms of thesis (MS and PhD), journal articles, conference proceedings, web materials, reports, books, handbooks on compressed air energy use, efficiency, energy savings strategies. Computer tools for compressed air analysis have been reviewed and presented in this paper. Various energy-saving measures, such as use of highly efficient motors, VSD, leak prevention, use of outside intake air, reducing pressure drop, recovering waste heat, use of efficient nozzle, and use of variable displacement compressor to save compressed-air energy have been reviewed. Based on review results, it has been found that for an electric motor used in a compressed-air system, a sizeable amount of electric energy and utility bill can be saved using high efficient motors and applying VSDs in matching speed requirements. Also, significant amounts of energy and emission are reducible through various energy-saving strategies. Payback periods for different energy savings measures have been identified and found to be economically viable in most cases.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing world energy use has already raised concerns over supply difficulties, exhaustion of energy resources and heavy environmental impacts (ozone layer depletion, global warming, climate change, etc.). The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching figures between 20{\%} and 40{\%} in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efficiency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly significant (50{\%} of building consumption and 20{\%} of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings. The case of offices is analysed in deeper detail.},

Empirical models can be worked out based on the results of specially organised measurements or continuous measurements recorded in the computer system storing the operational performance. The introduction of operational measurement data for material and energy balances required the separation of stationary sub-periods of boiler operations. For each separated sub-period of stationary operation thermal calculations based on DIN 1942 have been carried out. The results of calculations are utilized to estimate the neural model of a steam boiler. This model describes the dependence of the main operational parameters of the boiler upon the flue gas losses and losses due to unburned combustibles. The parameters of the neural model have been estimated by means of the back-propagation method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a scheme for on-line fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) at the subsystem level in an Air-Handling Unit (AHU). The approach consists of process estimation, residual generation, and fault detection and diagnosis. Residuals are generated using general regression neural-network (GRNN) models. The GRNN is a regression technique and uses a memory-based feed forward network to produce estimates of continuous variables. The main advantage of a GRNN is that no mathematical model is needed to estimate the system. Also, the inherent parallel structure of the GRNN algorithm makes it attractive for real-time fault detection and diagnosis. Several abrupt and performance degradation faults were considered. Because performance degradations are difficult to introduce artificially in real or experimental systems, simulation data are used to evaluate the method. The simulation results show that the GRNN models are accurate and reliable estimators of highly non-linear and complex AHU processes, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting and diagnosing faults in an AHU.},

They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with non-linear problems, and once trained can perform predictions and generalisations at high speed. They have been used in diverse applications in control, robotics, pattern recognition, forecasting, medicine, power systems, manufacturing, optimisation, signal processing, and social/psychological sciences. They are particularly useful in system modelling, such as in implementing complex mapping and system identification. This paper presents various applications of neural networks in energy problems in a thematic rather than a chronological or any other way. Artificial neural networks have been used by the author in the field of solar energy; for modelling and design of a solar steam generating plant, for the estimation of a parabolic-trough collector's intercept factor and local concentration ratio and for the modelling and performance prediction of solar water-heating systems. They have also been used for the estimation of heating-loads of buildings, for the prediction of air flows in a naturally ventilated test room and for the prediction of the energy consumption of a passive solar building. In all such models, a multiple hidden-layer architecture has been used. Errors reported when using these models are well within acceptable limits, which clearly suggests that artificial neural-networks can be used for modelling in other fields of energy production and use. The work of other researchers in the field of energy is also reported. This includes the use of artificial neural-networks in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, solar radiation, modelling and control of power-generation systems, load-forecasting and refrigeration.},

abstract = {The expert system for fouling assessment development is one of the possible approachs to the mitigation of deposit formation on boiler heat transfer surfaces. This paper presents the evaluation of the diagnostic variables and their domain based on the criteria for the fouling assessment. In agreement with the boiler furnace design, respective fields for the deposit control are selected to be instrumented with the âcleanâ radiation heat flux and ânot-cleanedâ radiation heat flux for the on-line reading. The ratio of the âcleanâ and ânot-cleanâ radiation heat flux is proved to be a sensitive diagnostic variable for the deposit thickness. The rate of change of radiation heat flux ratio, together with the efficiency of the heat transfer surface, are diagnostic variables used for the design of the expert system knowledge base. The knowledge base structure is based on the object oriented concept. In this respect the FOULING object is defined. Its structure is composed of the respective attributes and values linked with the number of situations to be selected for the assessment. The examples given are related to a 300 MWe power-plant boiler furnace. It includes the number of situations reflecting different deposit formation situations: total and upper level of side surface of fouling deposit.},

abstract = {Fouling and slagging are some difficulties for the development of biomass as energy potential and to achieve the targets of renewable energy sources utilization. The proper technique to analyze the influence of fouling in a biomass boiler is to monitorize the evolution of heat absorption in heat transfer equipment. Traditional equation-based monitoring techniques have problems to tackle with this complex phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to present the methodology of Neural Network (NN) design and application for a biomass boiler monitoring and point out the advantages of NN in these situations. A combination of traditional methods aided with a NN structure to monitorize the boiler could completely solve the problem. NN monitorizing results show an excellent agreement with real data. It is also concluded that NN is a stronger tool for monitoring than equation-based monitoring. This work will be the basis of a future development in order to control and minimize the effect of fouling in biomass boilers.},

abstract = {Refrigeration is part of everyday life and can be found in the home, car, office and industry. It is used very widely for food preservation, thermal comfort, food and drinks processing and chemical manufacturing. Since the inception of mechanical refrigeration towards the end of the 19th century two principal refrigeration cycles have emerged, the vapour compression and the vapour absorption cycle. The former cycle has dominated domestic and commercial applications due to its higher efficiency, smaller size and lower cost for the same refrigeration capacity. In recent years, environmental impacts from the working fluids of vapour compression systems, energy consumption and materials used in the construction of refrigeration equipment have increased pressure on the refrigeration industry to reduce the impacts of refrigeration systems through better design and control. This chapter presents results of investigations into the application of artificial intelligence techniques, based on Artificial Neural Networks, for the utilisation of data already collected from many large supermarkets for energy prediction, performance diagnosis and control. The results demonstrate that artificial intelligence can be used effectively to reduce both the energy consumption of refrigeration systems and predict deterioration in system performance due to gradual refrigerant leakage.

abstract = {Using feedforward neural networks (FNNs), a fault diagnosis and severity assessment (FDIA) scheme for a screw compressor has been established. This FDIA method consists of non-linear model identification of the compressor and pattern classification of parameters of identified models corresponding to the various faulty conditions. First, a non-linear input/output model is identified in the form FNNs. Then an FNN classifies the FNN model into one of the possible faults or the baseline conditions. If the model is classified as a faulty one, another FNN is used to assess the severity of the fault. A fully automatic structure and weight learning algorithm for FNNs is utilised to identify an FNN non-linear model from operating data of the compressor. To establish training data for the classifiers, measurements of motor current and shaft speed were made under baseline conditions and faulty conditions such as various extents of gaterotor wear and increased rolling friction. Experimental results show that the scheme is capable of not only diagnosing the faults but also assessing the magnitude of faults.},

Our approach is based on the idea that different kinds of knowledge in a given domain, namely declarative, procedural and heuristic are supported by corresponding methods and software tools. A prototype knowledge-based system, called EXPERT-MM, for the maintenance activities in the Siam Gipsum Industry (Bangkok, Thailand) has been worked out as a case study and is described in the paper. EXPERT-MM supports three main functions: maintenance policy suggestions, machine diagnosis and maintenance scheduling. The maintenance policy deals with the three types of preventive maintenance. For each component of the equipment it analyses the historical failure data and recommends an appropriate policy with optimal preventive maintenance intervals. This is based on the experts' knowledge stored in a knowledge base. A rotary screw type air compressor is selected for a diagnosis. The knowledge representation scheme is rule-based and the inference strategy mechanism is backward chaining. The knowledge-acquisition process has been organized and realised using a decision tree diagram. The knowledge base contains 154 rules for the diagnosis and 54 rules for the maintenance model selection. the maintenance scheduling module is procedure based. EXPERT-MM development is based on the software tools dBase III Plus, TURBO PASCAL version 6.0 and expert system shell EXSYS, all integrated into a single software system with a user-friendly interface.},

Four major faults of compressor fault, condenser fault, evaporator fault, and refrigerant leakage, were implemented by observing the variation of cooling capacity. Two different rule-based modules for constant and variable speed operations were organized for an easy diagnosis of system faults. These two modules were applied differently as the cooling capacity satisfies the necessary air conditioning load. As a result, COP degradation due to the fault in a variable speed system is severer than that in a constant speed system.},

One of the dampers was controlled by using the required temperature for the interested indoor volume while the other damper was controlled by using the required humidity for the same indoor volume. The realized system has a zone with variable flow-rate by considering the ambient temperature and humidity. In the authorsâ previous theoretical work, PID parameters were theoretically obtained by using fuzzy sets for the same HVAC system. Optimization with Fuzzy Modeling Approach of PID parameters has been performed to maximize the performance of the system. The obtained PID parameters in the previous theoretical work were used in this study. Besides, the damper gap rates of a HVAC system with only one zone were predicted by using Artificial Neural Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS) method. The inputâoutput data sets of this system were first stored and then these data sets were used to obtain its intelligent model and control based on ANFIS. Efficiency of the developed ANFIS method was tested and a mean 99.98{\%} recognition success was obtained. This paper shows that the values predicted with the ANFIS can be used to predict damper gap rate of HVAC system quite accurately.

Its key is a cost-effective Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) method. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a new method by combining the model-based FDD method and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. A lumped-parameter model of a single zone HVAC system is developed first, and then the characteristics of three major faults, including the recirculation damper stuck, cooling coil fouling/block and supply fan speed decreasing, are investigated by computer simulation. It is found that the supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, outlet water temperature and control signal are sensitive to the faults and can be selected as the fault indicators. Based on the variations of the system states under the normal and faulty conditions of different degrees, the faults can be detected efficiently by using the residual analysis method. Furthermore, a multi-layer SVM classifier is developed, and the diagnosis results show that this classifier is effective with high accuracy. As a result, the presented Model-Based Fault Detection and Diagnosis (MBFDD) method can help to maintain the health of the HVAC systems, reduce energy consumption and maintenance cost.},

abstract = {This paper describes how a model-based feedforward control scheme can improve control performance over traditional PI(D) and detect faults in the controlled process. The scheme uses static simulation models of the system under control to generate feedforward control action, which supplements a conventional PI(D) feedback loop. The feedforward action reduces the effect of plant non-linearity on control performance and provides more consistent disturbance rejection as operating conditions change. In addition to generating feedforward control action, the models act as a reference of correct operation. Faults that occur in the system under control cause the PI(D) loop to provide a greater than normal control action to compensate for fault-induced discrepancies between the feedforward models and the controlled process. By monitoring the level of feedback compensation, faults can be detected in the controlled process. The paper presents results from testing the controller with a simulated dual-duct air-handling unit. We also discuss recent experiences of implementing the control scheme in a real building using the BACnet communication protocol.},

There is a requirement for a real-time performance monitoring approach to leak detection and fault diagnosis which overcomes these disadvantages. This paper reports on the development of a fault diagnosis and refrigerant leak detection system based on artificial intelligence and real-time performance monitoring. The system has been used successfully to distinguish between faulty and fault free operation, steady-state and transient operation, leakage and over charge conditions. Work currently underway is aimed at testing additional fault conditions and establishing further rules to distinguish between these patterns.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop an expert system, entitled exact (EXpert system for Automobile air-conditioner Compressor Troubleshooting), to support field engineers to conduct the effective diagnosis of compressor troubles. exact runs under three software environments in the PC: exsys, Foxbase+, and Autocad. The expert system module is handled by the exsys environment. exsys shows the results of the diagnosis using an executable external program created in Quickbasic. The Foxbase environment handles the user interface and database management features. On the results screen of the expert system, a pictorial information module is provided under the Autocad environment for locating the trouble area in the compressor. Fifty real-world cases have been used to evaluate the system performance. The results of the validation test indicated that exact estimated the true cause of troubles with an accuracy of 82{\%}, whereas the human expert estimated it with an accuracy of 76{\%}. Another judgement factor in the validation is the time taken by the inspector to obtain the true cause when he/she follows each evaluator's diagnosis. The results indicated that the performance of exact was superior to that of the human expert.},

abstract = {This works focuses on using neural networks and expert systems to control a gas/solid sorption chilling machine. In such systems, the cold production changes cyclically with time due to the batchwise operation of the gas/solid reactors. The accurate simulation of the dynamic performance of the chilling machine has proven to be difficult for standard computers when using deterministic models. Additionally, some model parameters dynamically change with the reaction advancement. A new modelling approach is presented here to simulate the performance of such systems using neural networks. The backpropagation learning rule and the sigmoid transfer function have been applied in feedforward, full connected, single hidden layer neural networks. Overall control of this system is divided in three blocks: control of the machine stages, prediction of the machine performance and fault diagnosis.

abstract = {Efficient and reliable operation is the main requirement of the modern power plant. The most probable reason for failure in the power plant boiler is tube leakage. It is usually detected when urgent action is needed to prevent accidents in the plant. Advance detection of boiler leakage is of primary interest to secure maintenance planning and prevent the adverse effect of tube rupture. The development of the tube failure detection system is a demanding issue for the large power plant boilers. The present paper describes the development of an expert system for detecting boiler tube leakage. The system is based on selected diagnostic variables obtained by radiation heat flux measurements. A sensitivity analysis of the diagnostic variables is performed. A three-dimensional mathematical model of the boiler furnace is used to obtain the confidence level for the minimum leakage to be detected. The design of the expert system is based on relative values of the radiation flux reading as the diagnostic parameter. The leakage detection expert system is designed in the knowledge base environment, comprising the knowledge base containing facts, information on how to reason with these facts and inference mechanisms able to convert information from the knowledge base into user requested information. The knowledge base is based on the object-oriented structure with the definition of the object LEAKAGE. The object class LEAKAGE is composed of subclasses SENSOR and CASES. The inference procedure uses a set of procedural processes in the preparation of diagnostic variables reading for the decision making process. A fuzzification process is used for conversion of actual diagnostic values into semantic values. The several steps of the inference procedure lead to the logic processing of individual and collective representation of diagnostic variables represented in the knowledge base. A number of examples are given for leakage detection based on the expert system reasoning and monitoring representative situations which are imminent to the set of parameters describing situations preceding boiler tube rupture.},

abstract = {All areas of industry are affected by premature failure of components which must be investigated so as to avoid future repetition. However, the complexity of the interrelations between design stress and environment often makes this a daunting task, except for the engineer with considerable knowledge or experience in failure analysis. Modern developments in information technology should allow this task to be made easier by storing and subsequently accruing this âexperienceâ by using expert and knowledge-based systems. The application of these systems to the task of failure analysis, and design against failure, is reviewed, particular emphasis being placed on the reasoning methodologies used and the knowledge domains for which these methodologies are appropriate. Case-based reasoning techniques are considered to be the most suitable for generic failure analysis due to the complexity of knowledge required. It is concluded that future trends in diagnostic expert systems will be based on the holistic hybrid rule-case-based reasoning approach combined with a number of stand-alone engineering failure analysis calculating software tools, and a multimedia-type knowledge-based system for different failure modes.},

abstract = {A prototype expert system, called MODEX, for locating the cause(s) of a set of abnormalities in a chemical process id described. We discuss a methodology that aids the developement of expert systems which are process-independent, transparent in their reasoning, and capable of diagnosing a wide diversity of faults. The domain knowlege of the system is based on qualitative reasoning principles and captures physical interconnections between equipment units as well as causal relationships among process state variables. The inference strategy uses model-based reasoning for analyzing the plant behavior. Using a variant of the technique adopted from fault tree synthesis, an initially observed abnormal symptom is considered to be a top level event and a tree structure is constructed as the system searches for a basic event to which the fault can be traced. The diagnostic reasoning process is driven by a problem reduction strategy. The knowledge base is process-independent, thereby enhancing the generality of the expert system. Reasoning from first-principles with the aid of causal and fault models facilitates the diagnoses of novel or unanticipated faults. The system does not assume a single causal origin for all initially observed faults in the chemical process. Moreover, the system has the ability to locate multiple basic causes of a fault. The methodology also permits one to investigate the causal origins of multiple, unrelated, faults. The system provides explanations to user queries at various degrees of detail. Two test cases are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {This paper presents a critical and analytical description of an ongoing research program aimed at the implementation of an expert system capable of monitoring, through an Intelligent Health Control procedure, the instantaneous performance of a cogeneration plant. An application has been tested on a real plant, located on the grounds of the ENEA-Casaccia Energy Laboratories. The expert system, denominated PROMISE as the Italian acronym for PROgnostic and Intelligent Monitoring Expert System, generates, in real time and in a form directly useful to the plant manager, information on the existence and severity of faults, forecasts on the future time history of both detected and likely faults, and suggestions on how to control the problem. The expert procedure, working where and if necessary with the support of a process simulator, derives from real-time data a list of selected performance indicators for each plant component. For a set of faults, pre-defined with the help of the plant operator, proper rules are defined in order to establish whether the component is working correctly; in several instances, since one single failure (symptom) can originate from more than one fault (cause), complex sets of rules expressing the combination of multiple indices have been introduced in the knowledge base as well. Creeping faults are detected by analyzing the trend of the variation of an indicator in a pre-assigned interval of time. Whenever the value of this âdiscrete time derivativeâ becomes âhighâ with respect to a specified limit value, a âlatent creeping faultâ condition is prognosed. The expert system architecture is based on an object-oriented paradigm. The knowledge base (facts and rules) is clustered: the chunks of knowledge pertain to individual components. A graphic user interface (GUI) allows the user to interrogate PROMISE about its rules, procedures, classes and objects, and about its inference path. The paper also presents the results of some tests conducted on the real plant.},

abstract = {The problem of malfunction diagnosis in energy systems can be approached using an expert system which compares the experimental data measured by the plant acquisition system and the calculated data evaluated by a plant simulator under the same operating conditions. In this paper the rules that form the "knowledge base" of the expert system are not assigned heuristically by trying to code the expertise of plant personnel, as it is usually done, but they are artificially and randomly generated by the recombination and selection operators of an evolutionary algorithm. A two-objective optimization problem is set up, in order to search for the optimal sets of rules having the minimum complexity but simultaneously maximizing the number of correct fault identifications for a given set of malfunctioning operating conditions. A global and a local approach are applied to a real test case, a two-shaft gas turbine used as the gas section of a combined-cycle cogeneration plant, in order to evaluate the potentialities and the limits of this methodology.},

abstract = {Changes in complex industrial energy systems require adequate tools to be evaluated satisfactorily. The MIND method (Method for analysis of INDustrial energy systems) is a flexible method constructed as decision support for different types of analyses of industrial energy systems. It is based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and developed at Link{\"{o}}ping University in Sweden. Several industries, ranging from the food industry to the pulp and paper industry, have hitherto been modelled and analyzed using the MIND method. In this paper the principles regarding the use of the method and the creation of constraints of the modelled system are presented. Two case studies are also included, a dairy and a pulp and paper mill, that focus some measures that can be evaluated using the MIND method, e.g. load shaping, fuel conversion and introduction of energy efficiency measures. The case studies illustrate the use of the method and its strengths and weaknesses. The results from the case studies are related to the main issues stated by the European Commission, such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvements regarding security of supply and increased use of renewable energy, and show great potential as regards both cost reductions and possible load shifting.},

abstract = {Abnormal Situation Management (ASM) has received considerable attention from industry and academia recently. The first step towards better ASM is the timely detection and diagnosis of the abnormal situation, Most of the existing methods for fault diagnosis assume that only a single fault occurs at any given time. However, multiple faults do occur in processes, albeit less frequently than single faults. When multiple faults occur, existing methods either lead to incorrect diagnosis or complete lack of diagnosis. Multiple fault diagnosis (MFD) is a difficult problem because the number of combinations grows exponentially with the number of faults. In this paper, a signed directed graph (SDG) based algorithm for MFD is developed. The computational complexity is efficiently handled by assuming that the probability of occurrence of a multiple fault scenario decreases with an increasing number of faults involved. SDG based diagnosis, like any other qualitative method, has poor resolution. This poor resolution is overcome by using a knowledge base consisting of knowledge about the process constraints, maintenance schedules etc. The proposed algorithm is implemented in Gensym' s expert system shell, G2. The application of the algorithm is illustrated using an industrial scale simulation of the standard FCCU called TRAINER.},

An existing office building is used as a case study to demonstrate the process of commissioning. Building energy benchmarking tools are applied to evaluate the energy performance for screening opportunities at the whole building level. A large natural gas saving potential was indicated by the building benchmarking results. Faulty operations in the HVAC systems, such as improper operations of air-side economizers, simultaneous heating and cooling, and ineffective optimal start, were identified through trend data analyses and functional testing. The energy saving potential for each commissioning measure is quantified with a calibrated building simulation model. An actual energy saving of 10{\%} was realized after the implementations of cost-effective measures.},

abstract = {Many researchers working in the field of knowledge engineering (KE) are now concerned with identifying a model suitable for developing knowledge-based software and, especially, expert systems (ES). It is important to find a standard model that meets current needs and incorporates techniques successfully implemented in SE (object- or event-orientation, etc.), which are also of keen interest in KE. In this paper, we present an iterative and incremental solution for developing ES, according to which the system domain is derived naturally from the problem domain, thus surmounting the problems now involved in the transition from the conceptual model of the problem to the formal model of the system. As compared with conventional development models, this solution encompasses five main tools, which are: â¢ Use cases with their respective actor interaction diagrams and activity flow diagrams in order to specify the expert system. â¢ The concept dictionary, which allows knowledge engineers to define, bound and select the meaning of each concept used by experts. â¢ The static conceptual model, which provides an overview (concepts and their relations) of the expert system (ES) modelled. â¢ The control and process model, which models the knowledge and metaknowledge used by the expert to attain a goal. â¢ An object-oriented metamodel, which outputs the formal knowledge model, providing an efficient, reusable, extendible and easy-to-implement ES architecture. To demonstrate the robustness of this solution, we describe how it was applied to an ES that interprets the graphs output by an isokinetics machine for a blind person. An isokinetics machine assesses the strength of the muscles of the leg, arm, etc.},

DISCUSSION


Philip Haves, Group Leader, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, Calif.: (1) A number of your rules rely on the mixed air temperature measurement. Did you have averaging sensors in the air handlers you studied? (2) If there isn't an averaging sensor for the mixed air temperature, can


your rule set be modified to detect mixing box faults without using a measurement of mixed air temperature?


John House: (1) Yes, all the air handlers at the field site were equipped with averaging sensors for measuring the mixed air temperature. (2) If there isn't an averaging sensor or if the existing averaging sensor is known to give unreliable measurements, it is unlikely that mixing box faults could be detected with this rule set. The most obvious way that I can think of to circumvent this problem would be to use a modelbased value of the mixed air temperature in place of the actual measurement. A reasonable estimate of the mixed air temperature should be obtainable using the outdoor air and return air temperatures and the control signal to the mixing box dampers.},

abstract = {The retrofitting of existing buildings is an area of research that requires development in order to overcome the 'rule of thumb' based approach currently being undertaken. Simulation-based optimization is one approach that can assist consultant engineers, architects and other professionals who undertake retrofit projects. This paper presents a degree-days simulation technique coupled with a genetic algorithms optimization procedure to propose optimal retrofit solutions. The research is applied to a recently retrofitted case-study building. A comparison between the implemented retrofit solution and the simulation-based optimal solution is included to demonstrate the applicability of the research to real-world situations. This research demonstrates the necessity to carry out analysis of a project before retrofit works commence to ensure an optimal approach is taken in accordance with the project specific criteria.},

abstract = {Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system energy consumption accounts for an average of 40{\%} of an industrial sites energy consumption. Studies have indicated that 20 â 30{\%} energy savings are achievable by recommissioning Air Handling Units (AHU) in HVAC systems to rectify faulty operation. Studies have also demonstrated that continuous commissioning of building systems for optimum efficiency can yield savings of an average of over 20{\%} of total energy cost. Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) is a process concerned with automating the detection of faults and their causes in physical systems. AFDD can help support multiple stages in the commissioning process. This paper outlines the development of an AFDD tool for AHUâs using expert rules then details the results of its beta testing phase on twenty-six AHUâs across six large commercial {\&} manufacturing sites. To date, validated energy savings of over â¬157,000 have been identified by the AFDD tool.},

@article{Bailey2003,
abstract = {Reliable, automated detection and diagnosis of abnormal behavior within vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC) equipment is extremely desirable for equipment owners and operators. The specific type of VCRC equipment studied in this paper is a 70-ton helical rotary, air-cooled chiller. The fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) tool developed as part of this research analyzes chiller operating data and detects faults through recognizing trends or patterns existing within the data. The FDD method incorporates a neural network (NN) classifier to infer the current state given a vector of observables. Therefore the FDD method relies upon the availability of normal and fault empirical data for training purposes and therefore a fault library of empirical data is assembled. This paper presents procedures for conducting sophisticated fault experiments on chillers that simulate air-cooled condenser, refrigerant, and oil related faults. The experimental processes described here are not well documented in literature and therefore will provide the interested reader with a useful guide. In addition, the authors provide evidence, based on both thermodynamics and empirical data analysis, that chiller performance is significantly degraded during fault operation. The chiller's performance degradation is successfully detected and classified by the NN FDD classifier as discussed in the paper's final section.},

abstract = {The paper describes several types of efficiency enhancements of 'classical' rule-based diagnostic expert systems. The blackboard control structure enables to explore more knowledge bases of the same syntax in parallel, the taxonomy structures make fast zooming of attention possible and provide additional inference mechanism based on inheritance principles. The applicability of the enhancing techniques is documented by four case studies exploring the extended FEL-EXPERT shell in different tasks of medical decision-making. The authors consider the enhancing techniques as useful steps on the way from 'classical' diagnostic expert systems towards more complex multi-agent decision tools.},

abstract = {Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system energy consumption on average accounts for 40{\%} of an industrial sites total energy consumption. Studies have indicated that 20 â 30{\%} energy savings are achievable by re-commissioning HVAC systems to rectify faulty operation with savings of over 20{\%} of total energy cost possible by continuously commissioning. Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) is a process concerned with automating the detection of faults and their causes in physical systems. AFDD can be used to identify faults in HVAC systems with a view to reducing their energy consumption. An AFDD tool has been designed and developed to allow the performance analysis of AHUâs by utilising knowledge-based principles. Based on an initial alpha testing phase on 12 AHUâs across four large industrial pilot sites, in excess of â¬120,000 of energy savings have been detected by the AFDD tool and verified by site survey.},

abstract = {The evolving capabilities of Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) offer new opportunities to automate some parts of the commissioning process and can generate benefits over the entire life of a building. These benefits include a reduction of process cost and manual effort on site, improved quality assurance process and the adoption of automated energy audit capabilities to improve overall building performance. This paper presents the concept for a new automated commissioning tool that verifies and optimizes the performance of building HVAC systems using the capabilities of BEMS. The tool is applicable mainly to commercial and institutional buildings. In its simplest form, the tool monitors building control data and stores it in a structured database to be used on- line or upon request. Data resulting from standardized test procedures invoked manually or automatically are also stored in the database. A reasoning algorithm performs an intelligent analysis of the monitored data and also performs additional automated commissioning of HVAC components and systems, identifying faults, diagnosing them, and evaluating the potential energy efficiency improvements. The process is completed by sending detailed comprehensive reports to the user. This paper also includes an example showing how an automated BEMS-assisted commissioning tool can potentially be applied to improve the energy performance of variable-air-volume fan systems.},

abstract = {Air handling unit performance assessment rules (APAR) is a fault detection tool that uses a set of expert rules derived from mass and energy balances to detect faults in air handling units (AHUs). Control signals are used to determine the mode of operation of the AHU. A subset of the expert rules which correspond to that mode of operation are then evaluated to determine whether a fault exists. APAR is computationally simple enough that it can be embedded in commercial building automation and control systems and relies only upon the sensor data and control signals that are commonly available in these systems. APAR was tested using data sets collected from a âhardware-in-the-loopâ emulator and from several field sites. APAR was also embedded in commercial AHU controllers and tested in the emulator.},
