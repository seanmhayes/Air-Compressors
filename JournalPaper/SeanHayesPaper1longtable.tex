\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

In 2012 industry consumed 2,542 Mtoe of energy globally, which represented  over 28\% of the 8,980 Mtoe of global final energy consumption \cite{IEA2012}. In an Irish context, industry consumed 2.26 Mtoe of energy in 2012, representing almost 22\% of Ireland’s 10.3 Mtoe of final energy consumption. Within the category of industrial energy, compressed air is recognised as an energy intensive utility, accounting for 10\% of industrial electricity in the European Union \cite{Saidur2010}. Energy costs typically account for 78\% of the total life cycle cost of a compressed air system \cite{radgen2006efficiency}. Compressed air is known colloquially in industry as the “fourth fuel”, due to the high electrical cost associated with generation. Compressed air systems are typically running at 19\% overall system efficiency \cite{Saidur2010}, due to energy losses largely due to lost heat of generation and leakages.

Compressed air has been recognised as having significant energy saving potential in the food industry \cite{Wang2014}, not least through measures such as retrofitting of variable speed drives, inlet air temperature reduction, waste heat recovery, and pressure and leakage reduction (cite Wang 2008 from Wang 2014 paper).

\section{Thermodynamics of Air Compression}
The thermodynamics of air compression are outlined in \autoref{fig:thermocomp}.

\section{Determining the operational performance of an air compressor}
\label{sec:probstatement}
A wide range of configurations and types of compressed air systems are installed in industry. In many cases there exist systems which are running sub-optimally, either due to unsuitability for the task at hand or running in a faulty condition. Given that compressed air represents such a dense form of energy transport, it is beneficial in terms of long and short term overall energy efficiency goals to manage the performance of air compressors. Performance management is typically achieved through means such as those in  \autoref{tab:perfmgmt}. The key disadvantages of existing methods are either that they are manual and periodic in nature, or that they require the intervention of a human expert in compressed air systems to be effective. In the case of maintenance contracts and periodic audits, there is also the potential for unnecessary work to be carried out, as both these measures are typically carried out on a timescale basis. The intervention of a human expert also lends itself to an inefficient method of performance measurement. An expert may be particularly well versed with one type of system, but not another. The disparate range of compressed air systems can lead to an expert restricting themselves to one type of system, preventing possible lessons learned to be applied in other suitable cases.

%	Bumph about current methods to detect performance degradation

In order to analyse a particular compressed air system it is useful to understand how it might relate to other installations. The system analysed in this paper consists of two rotary tooth air compressors with a heated desiccant dryer, with the layout given in \autoref{fig:compairlayout}. These machines are rotary tooth type machines, which are widely deployed across industry for applications with medium pressure and capacity requirements, as shown in \autoref{fig:CompApps}\cite{SEAI2007} The various types of compressors typically used in industry are shown in \autoref{fig:comptypes}. Reciprocating and rotary machines are both positive displacement type machines. They work through isolation of a quantity of air in a space which is then reduced in volume. Centrifugal machines are aerodynamic machines, which operate by imparting kinetic energy to air, which is then converted to pressure energy by stopping the moving air. The three most common types of compressor in industry are rotary, reciprocating and centrifugal machines. The application ranges of these types are shown in \autoref{fig:CompApps} \cite{SEAI2007}.

\subsection{Rule formulation methodology}
\label{subsec:rulemethodology}

One of the approaches for performance management of air compressors outlined in \autoref{subsec:perfmgmtmethods} is that of Expert Systems. This is a qualitative method which can use rule sets to encode expert knowledge about a system for flagging when a fault in operation is present. This method has been used with success in the case of HVAC (\cite{Bruton2014}, \cite{House2001}) and the area of air compressors (\cite{Liu2001}). Rules for system analysis are typically derived by taking a fundamental engineering overview of the system, and hypothesising potential rules to determine particular faults.

\autoref{fig:compairflow} shows a high level overview of the test site air compressor, which is a two-stage rotary tooth machine. The figure highlights the expected temperature changes as the compressed air is operated on y each fundamental component. These expected operations form the basis for an initial set of rules to flag when the machine is not operating as expected. To illustrate this point the first element of compression is analysed in detail.

Element 1 of the air compressor compresses air from atmospheric pressure (\SI{101325}{\pascal}) to \SI{250000}{\pascal}. When the compressor is at minimum loading, it is designed to produce \SI{41}{\liter \per \second} of free air. It is useful to analyse the thermodynamics of compressing air at this point. \autoref{fig:thermocomp} shows the relevant thermodynamic diagrams for the compression of this volume of air isothermally, adiabatically and polytropically. The air is compressed in a space which is surrounded by ambient air, which is not an ideal heat reservoir. Therefore the isothermal compression case is not valid. The air is not however thermally isolated from its surroundings, therefore the adiabatic case is also not valid. Actual air compression typically follows the polytropic process model, with the polytropic exponent of \autoref{eq:polytropcompression} ranging between 1 and 1.4.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:polytropcompression}
P_1 V_1^n = P_2 V_2^n \\
\text{where}~P = \text{Absolute pressure (Pa)} \nonumber \\
\text{V} = \text{Absolute volume (m\textsuperscript{3})} \nonumber \\ 
n = \text{Polytropic exponent} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 

Given that the compression process taking place is not isothermal, it is logical to expect that the temperature of the compressed air will increase through the first element of compression, in accordance with \autoref{fig:thermocomp}. If a decrease in temperature is observed, then either a failure in the first stage of compression or in a temperature sensor can be determined. This forms the basis for the first rule of the rule set created for compressor performance analysis, which is summarised in \autoref{tab:ruleset}.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 1. } T1 - T2 > 0
\label{eq:rule1}
\end{equation}

In a similar manner to Rule 1, Rules 2, 3 and 4 fire when the expected temperature of the compressed air does not change as expected across the intercooler, second element of compression and aftercooler respectively.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 2. } T3 - T2 >0
\label{eq:rule2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 3. } T3 - T4 >0
\label{eq:rule3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 4. } T5 - T4 > 0
\label{eq:rule4}
\end{equation}

Rules 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are threshold rules, in that they fire when defined thresholds for T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively are exceeded. These threshold values have been devised through a combination of historical data analysis and manufacturer defined alarm levels where available.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 5. } T1 > \SI{35}{\degreeCelsius}
\label{eq:rule5}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 6. } T2 > \SI{155}{\degreeCelsius}
\label{eq:rule6}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 7. } T3 > \SI{24}{\degreeCelsius}
\label{eq:rule7}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 8. } T4 > \SI{120}{\degreeCelsius}
\label{eq:rule8}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 9. } T5 > \SI{21}{\degreeCelsius}
\label{eq:rule9}
\end{equation}

The first element of compression in a two-stage compressor is designed to compress air to an intermediate pressure, before intercooling and compression to final delivery pressure by the second element of compression. If this intermediate pressure is not acheived, it is indicative of either a pressure sensor fault, or a fault in element 1 operation. If the first element of compression is faulty in operation, this will lead to excessive strain on the second element of compression to achieve final delivery pressure. Rule 10 flags when this intermediate pressure is not met.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 10. } P1 < \SI{2.5}{\bar} + E6
\label{eq:rule10}
\end{equation}

For a single compressor in isolation, if the final delivery pressure continues to rise when the compressor is running in unloaded mode, it is indicative of either a fault in the relevant pressure sensor, or that the load/unload valve of the compressor has failed. Rule 11 fires when this pressure rise in unloaded mode takes place.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 11. } (P2(t) - (P2(t-1)) > 0
\label{eq:rule11}
\end{equation}

If the motor driving the compressor is switching on and off excessively, it will lead to premature wear and tear on the compressor mechanical drive. Rule 12 fires when a threshold for the number of motor starts has been exceeded.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 12. } \sum_{t = 0}^{300s}N1 > 2
\label{eq:rule12}
\end{equation}

In an air compressor lubricated by oil, the oil should circulate when the compressor is loaded. If the oil pressure does not rise with the compressor loaded, it is indicative of a blockage in the oil circulation system, a failure of the oil pump, or a pressure sensor fault.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 13. }(P4(t) + \SI{100}{\milli \bar}) < P4(t-1)
\label{eq:rule13}
\end{equation}

The compression of air in both the first and second element of a two-stage air compressor follows defined thermodynamic principles. If the compression chamber were thermally isolated from its surroundings, the compression would be adiabatic. If it were in thermal contact with an ideal heat reservoir, the compression would be isothermal. Neither of these is the case, and actual air compression is polytropic, as defined by \autoref{eq:polytropcompression}. The temperature rise of compressed air for each of the three types of compression is given in \autoref{fig:thermocomp}. The theoretical maximum temperature rise of air under compression is given by the adiabatic case. Therefore, while it is known that the air will compress polytropically, it can be assumed that if the outlet temperature of either the first or second element of compression is greater than that dictated by the adiabatic case (with the polytropic exponent of \autopageref{eq:polytropcompression} set to 1.4), then a fault is present in the system. This fault may either be in one of the relevant temperature sensors, or additional heat may be being supplied to the air under compression. This principle dictates when Rules 14 and 15 are fired.

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 14. } T2 > T1 * \left(\frac{P1}{P5}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}
\label{eq:rule14}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Rule 15. } T4 > T3 * \left(\frac{P2}{P1}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}
\label{eq:rule15}
\end{equation}

\section{Operational mode identification}
\label{sec:modeidentification}
It was noted during rule set development that it is desirable to know the mode of operation of an air compressor when applying rules. This follows on from lessons learned in similar work relating to HVAC \cite{Bruton2014}. With a HVAC unit, the different modes of operation that are useful to determine which rules to apply are Heating, Cooling with Outdoor Air, Mechanical Cooling with 100\% Air and Mechanical Cooling with Minimum Outdoor Air, with these modes categorised into Occupied and Unoccupied Modes \cite{House2001}. Knowing the mode of operation of equipment can ensure that rules are only applied where pertinent, reducing false positives.

The modes of operation designated for a variable speed air compressor are given in \autoref{tab:opmodes}. To determine which mode of operation the compressor is actually in, the power drawn by the machine was analysed. The Compressed Air and Gas Institute (CAGI) specifies a standard data sheet for air compressors which major manufacturers adhere to \cite{CAGI}. The input power to the compressor as given on this sheet where available is also given in \autoref{tab:opmodes}. Modes 1 and 3 were recognised as being useful modes to have knowledge of, despite not having prior knowledge of the associated input power from the CAGI data sheet. From visual observation of a power meter installed at the test site, it was noted that Mode 1 had an approximate power requirement of \SI{1}{\kilo \watt}, and Mode 2 an approximate power requirement of \SI{20}{\kilo \watt}

To monitor the power drawn by the compressor for mode identification, a clustering methodology was trialled. This unsupervised learning method allows the compressor power meter data to be grouped into distinct clusters as per \autoref{tab:opmodes}. An additional benefit to be gained from this approach is that a drift upward in the geometric mean or centroid of any cluster could diagnose a decrease in efficiency of the machine at that operating point, as more power is required to achieve the same output.

K-means clustering was used to group the electrical meter data into clusters. An initial attempt was made to cluster the data into two groups, i.e. Unloaded/Idle and Loaded or Modes 1-2 and 3-8 from \autoref{tab:opmodes} respectively.
